<!--
- Different Dimension Me: service discontinued
- Midjourney: payment model
- Adobe Firefly: not committing to the Adobe ecosystem as a hobbyist
- Imagen: less flexible than Stable Diffusion + LoRA
- Flux: high prompt adherence but less customizable (not designed for stylized art + LoRA)
- Whisk: not actually an image-to-image model, lower character consistency
- DALL·E 3: less flexible than Stable Diffusion + LoRA
-->

<!--
These are some of the models I tried but bounced off of me for one reason or another. I'm not going to go into too much detail about them now, but you can ask me after the presentation or check the slide notes for more details.
