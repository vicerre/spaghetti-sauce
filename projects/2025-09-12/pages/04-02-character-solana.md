The first character up is Solana. She's typically the first character I take a shot at with image generation models. It's a bit more involved than this, but you can get 95% of the way there by describing her as a red-headed girl with a tail. She's pretty nice as a baseline for what to expect out of diffusion-based models, though the last 5% is what makes her the hardest design to get right. You'll be seeing her in multiple design variations from one model to the next.
