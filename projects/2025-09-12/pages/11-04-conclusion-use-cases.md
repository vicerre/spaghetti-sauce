# What do image generation models do for me?

Also, as I said, it's just really fun seeing characters come to life. In this example, I've drawn my characters in the style of Magic: The Gathering cards, and from there, I was able to make custom mechanics of them. And this is just the tip of the iceberg for what I do creatively with my characters.
