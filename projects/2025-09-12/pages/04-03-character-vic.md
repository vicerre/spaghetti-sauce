Next up is Vic. He's the character I use as a "test subject" most often. He has some pretty uncommon features in his character design, such as the two-toned color of his hair, his pointy hair and nose, and the twisted shape of his scarf. Because of this, he's a pretty good character to test the limits of an image generation model. Whereas most image generation models can probably draw a cute girl, drawing a weird-looking guy is a biiit tricker.
