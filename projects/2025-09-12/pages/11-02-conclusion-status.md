# What do image generation models do well?

- Very high character fidelity
- Compositional understanding
- Good odds of "rolling" a good generation

<!--
Let's first go over what image generation models do well. Even when they aren't reliable, they go much farther in getting you to see useful reference images than looking up existing images. I consider image models to act like a personal assistant where they can draw my characters in different scenarios, and I can use that as a starting point for my other creative stuff.
