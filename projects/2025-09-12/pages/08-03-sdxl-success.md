Overall, it's a lot more cohesive than Stable Diffusion 1.5.

At the top left, you can see an example where I drew Vic sitting on a bench holding a cup of hot chocolate during the winter. The model's "batting average", so to speak, is a lot higher than Stable Diffusion 1.5 in making a cohesive scene.

You can even load up multiple LoRAs and get good results from this. At the top right, you can see what I got when I tried asking the model to draw Vic and Solana together. In the past, trying to load up two characters would cause the model to blend their features together, so the model being able to draw them separately is an improvement!

And at the bottom, I just think this result is a really good example of the model being able to draw pretty compositions. It's generations like these that give me ideas for how to draw my own illustrations.
