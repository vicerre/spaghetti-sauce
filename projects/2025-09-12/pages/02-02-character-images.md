<!--
I'm going to show you some examples here. On this slide, I've drawn my characters in a few different styles. We've got the characters fully-illustrated at the bottom right, and they're drawn in black and white over here. Then you've got the characters drawn as stick figures and pixel art over at the top right.

Despite the difference in styles, you can tell which character is which. There's a girl with curvy red hair and a guy with spiky hair. Or, to put another way, the curvy red hair indicates that this character is the girl, and the spiky hair indicates that this character is the guy. Details like these and a lot more are what make up a distinctive character design.
