- Integration with art programs (e.g. layers)
- Composition/storytelling
- Creativity and delight

Other desired areas of improvements:
- Consistent expressions: Dazed, neutral looks tend to be features of AI comics, I've seen.
- PR? OpenAI really gave artists an aversion to AI for being ethically shady.

Finally: What do I want for the future of image generation technology?

I think currently, there's a big gap in what we've been using image models for and what would actually be helpful to artists. There isn't an art model that'll give you a tutorial of how to apply proper shading or how to draw on multiple layers. A lot of image generation models focus on stuff that looks good, but as we've been finding out, that's not really what people are looking for. They're looking what the human is trying to share by making art.

One of the aspects of image generation I haven't found any models really excel at is with comics and expressions. Image generation models aren't good at sequences, much less trying to tell a coherent story with a sequence of images. Nano Banana is close, but there still needs work to be done, and even then, I don't know when it'll be that it can really get human-level. I'm hoping that companies like Google and Adobe are able to make image generation models more than just an AI filter ontop of what a human is looking to make!
