- To an extent, a lot of this content is historical by now! It's a bit like covering the flight of the Wright brothers and how that led to modern aviation technology. The technology has accelerated to the point where people treat it as a baseline expectation. Meanwhile, it's engineers like us who get starry-eyed over how things like this even work.

In this presentation, we'll first go over what I mean when I say character designs and image generation technology, and then we'll go over my experiences using image generation technology for character designs.

I'll try to cover the topics in this presentation in a way that's accessible to people who aren't familiar with the concepts of visual design and to people who haven't worked hands-on with diffusion-based models. If you have any questions about any elements I didn't cover in this presentation, I'll be happy to answer them at the end of the end!

With that said, let's get started with our first topic.
