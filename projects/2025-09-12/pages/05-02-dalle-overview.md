# DALL·E 2

- Cloud-based
- First publicly available model to support image input → image output

- Interesting for:

- T2I: I think I see Matt Smith! :o
- Unfortunately, in 202x, OpenAI removed the ability to view legacy Dall·E model + generations, taking most of my generations with it. I tried submitting a data request to see if it was there, but the download would either fail, or if it "succeeded", and the zip file wouldn't open. 💀

The first model I used was Dall-E 2, released back in 2022. Before this, I played with text-to-image models like Neural Blender, but this was the first image generation model that supported generating images _from_ images, which is what got me curious.

So how did it do?
