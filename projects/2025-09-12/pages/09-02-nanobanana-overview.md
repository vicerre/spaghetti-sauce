# Gemini 2.5 Flash + Nano Banana

- Cloud-based
- Multimodal model

<!--
The next milestone and the last model on our timeline is the form of Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, otherwise referred to by its codename Nano Banana.

Unlike the previous models, which consisted of a single architecture with encoders for text and images, Nano Banana, to my understanding, consists of two models.

As a Large Language Model, Gemini sits in between the user and the image model Nano Banana, performing a degree of preprocessing on the user prompt and image before it's fed into the image model. What this really means is that the image model isn't responsible for interpreting everything, but that Gemini can do a lot of the thinking before it even reaches image generation.

Let's take a look at what Nano Banana makes.
