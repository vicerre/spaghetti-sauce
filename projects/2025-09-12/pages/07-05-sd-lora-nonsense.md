# Results

- Not great at figuring out cohesion
- I don't mind since image generations are inspirational at best
- Other people in the open-source community have developed tools to limit the extent of "nonsense" in outputs

- Also, overlap in keywords can also result in nonsense. E.g. asking for "watercolor" as a keyword produced both watercolor as an art style and watercolor supplies.

As we're seeing improvements in image generations, we're going to see improvements to what the limitations of these models are. Here are a few examples of parts where the model isn't quite there yet.

The image in the top left is a good basic example. It looks reasonable at a glance, but it has the problem a lot of models of the time have where it gets worse the more you look at it. For example, the red scarf blends into his turtleneck, and if you look closely, it can't draw fingers. There's something going on too with how the ponytail is off to his side rather than behind him.

The other three examples are pretty fun ways Stable Diffusion gets this wrong.

For the top right example, I asked for Vic with the keyword water, and it ended up dunking him in a body of water.

In the bottom left example, I asked for goldfish, and it drew him holding a gigantic goldfish somehow, like he's underwater.

In the bottom right example, I asked the model to draw him roasting a marshmallow over a campfire, and, well, it looks like there's no campfire, but his jacket's caught on fire.

Like overall, these three examples are pretty fun! Even if they aren't useful, they're helpful for inspiring creativity.
