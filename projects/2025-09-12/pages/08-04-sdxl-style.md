Like its predecessor, Stable Diffusion XL is great at adapting characters to different styles. Even beyond the previous test cases, it knows what aspects to keep to make you say, "Oh yeah, that's Vic as a pony." It's boiled his essential unique elements down to his brown and white hair and that red scarf.

This is a little hard to explain if you're not an designer, but if you compare these results to DALL-E at just trying to create variations of the same input image, I can see that the model has seen Vic and knows his features vs. just getting a description of him and trying to redraw him from memory.
