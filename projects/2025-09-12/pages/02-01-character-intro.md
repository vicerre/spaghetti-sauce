- The structured process of creating a visual design such that the design is:
  - consistently drawn within your creative work (intrinsically identifiable)
  - distinctive outside your creative work (extrinsically identifiable)
  - ...applied to fictional characters

So, what is a character design?

Well, the short version is that it applies the principles of design to characters. That's what it is, really. You want to make character designs look consistent within a body of work and visually distinctive of it. If you've worked with UX designers around the company, you're probably familiar with the concept of a "design language" in which the same principles are applied to UI elements and branding. The design language tells you that something looks like it belongs to [redacted]. This is basically the same thing, but for illustrative purposes.
