All right, and finally up is Alis. He has some pretty uncommon features such as the long, white coat, the very specific shape of his hair and this orange diamond brooch thing.

Also, for a while, he's also the character with the least art, so he's ended up being a good candidate to test how image generation models deal with low amounts of reference data.
