If you've seen me around the office, you might've seen these characters in the form of charms on my phone.

For the purpose of this presentation, all you need to know is the following:

- I designed these characters
- I like drawing these characters (choice of tech is Clip Studio Paint + Huion Kamvas 16)
- These characters have features that are challenging for AI models

If you want to learn more about them, check out my blog!

<!--
In this presentation, I'm going to be referring to three characters named Vic, Solana, and Alis. Each of them, as you'll see, will be used as image generation benchmarks in different ways.
