# Why character designs?

### Benchmarking

- Character designs are distinctive without being too obscure for image models to handle.

<!--
- Character designs are complex enough that they really challenge an image model's understanding of that character's _design_. You can't generate them by feeding a model a text prompt.
- E.g. like how the image "Lenna" used for image processing:
  - https://www.google.com/search?udm=2&q=lenna+test+subject+site%3Aarxiv.org
- I could try testing the model with non-human designs too, but I think humans are more interesting just because we're so much more aware sensitive to what a proper human looks like e.g. the Uncanny Valley effect.

So let's address the question, why? There are a lot of applications for image generation models, so why study character designs in particular?

Well, I think character designs are interesting because they build on that part we just last talked about. Models are great at generating images of what they have already seen. They do a pretty good job of generating combinations of images. Trying to give the model something it hasn't _really_ seen before, well... it's fun picking at the model's "brain" to see what works and what doesn't.

Character designs fill a good niche in that the model has seen all of the traits that a character design has, but they're really hard to nail accurately.

To show you what I mean, I'm going to share some examples of common benchmarks used in the image generation space.
