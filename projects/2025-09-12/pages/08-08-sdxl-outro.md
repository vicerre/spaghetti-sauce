# Summary

- Great improvements toward character fidelity
- Better at "understanding" a scene
- Failure cases are less entertaining wrong

<!--
Overall, Stable Diffusion XL is a lot better on a technical level. It's more cohesive and can draw more complex content. It's good, but kinda less fun than what I had seen before.
