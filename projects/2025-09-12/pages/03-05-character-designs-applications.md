# Why character designs?

### Applications

- Project-specific inspiration
- Project-specific art/design learning material
- Personal interests
- This will be explained in more detail later!

<!--

- An average person can tell what makes a generated image "look good". As an artist, I want to dissect this and re-apply it to my own creative media. This produces a feedback loop in which I'm able to make my art better in tandem with the development of generative AI technology.
- In the end, I'm interested in generative image models the same way you might be interested in looking at an artist's works.
- Not only do I use them to test the quality of a model, but the model output also gets re-integrated into drawings.

Okay, so what now? What is benchmarking good for, anyway? What are the applications?

Well, one of my hobbies is digital art. It's a bit of a lifetime endeavor as I try to develop my creative skills in a wide variety of media. Generative AI can act as an assistant of sorts, where I can feed it images, it can generate image results, and I can use the results for different purposes. Sometimes it's good for inspiration, and sometimes I can study the results and improve my art skills from them.

With that said, let's take a look at the character designs I'll be working with in more detail and how I'll be using them in checking out image generation models.
