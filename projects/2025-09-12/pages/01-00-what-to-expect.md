# What to expect

1. We'll briefly cover character design and image generation models conceptually
2. We'll look at my experience with using image generation models to reproduce character designs 

We'll cover both design and technical elements, but in an approachable way (i.e. not too design- or tech-heavy)

> **Note:** All dates in the presentation represent when <ins>I</ins> tried out the model, not when it first released.
